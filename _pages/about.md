I am a particle physicist specialised in neutrino detection with liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs). I completed my PhD at the University of Manchester, where my research focuses on advancing LArTPC technology to improve the precision and reach of solar neutrino measurements, with data analysis playing a central role throughout my work. I also hold an MSc in Physics from University College London and a BSc in Physics with Astronomy from the University of São Paulo.

Alongside my academic research, I have developed a strong interest in applied data analysis in real-world settings. At Amazon Logistics in London, I analysed large operational datasets, automated reporting and data-processing pipelines, and supported both strategic and time-critical decisions in a fast-paced environment. This experience complemented my research background by emphasising clarity, robustness, and impact in data-driven work. In parallel, I actively pursue software development projects, particularly in data analysis, automation, and scientific computing.

In parallel with my scientific and analytical work, aviation is a passion of mine. I am a licensed private pilot in both Brazil and the United Kingdom, and I value the discipline, situational awareness, and procedural rigour that flying demands.
