**Welcome to my page!**

My name is Guilherme, and I am a particle physicist and PhD candidate at the University of Manchester, where I study solar neutrinos using liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs). My research is aimed at advancing LArTPC technology to enable more precise and comprehensive solar neutrino measurements. I hold an MSc in Physics from University College London and a BSc in Physics with Astronomy from the University of SÃ£o Paulo.

Alongside my academic work, I gained practical experience at Amazon Logistics in London, where I automated reports and data processing, collaborated with diverse stakeholders, and balanced strategic projects with urgent operational tasks. I also pursue software development as a personal interest and hold private aeroplane pilot licenses from Brazil and the UK.
