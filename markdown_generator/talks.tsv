Construction and tests of GEM kind gas detectors related to the ALICE experiment upgrade	Talk	SIICUSP	24th SIICUSP	2016-09-12	São Paulo, Brazil		Short presentation at the 24th International Symposium on Scientific and Technological Initiation (SIICUSP), an event held annually at the University of São Paulo that aims to disseminate the results of scientific and technological research projects carried out by undergraduate students from USP and other national and international institutions.
SoLAr: a novel technology for solar neutrino detection	Talk	nuphys	NuPhys2023: Prospects in Neutrino Physics	2023-12-19	London, UK		The SoLAr concept introduces a novel liquid-argon neutrino detector technology to enhance sensitivity in the MeV energy range, broadening the scope to include solar and supernovae neutrinos. This technology is based on a monolithic light-charge pixel-based readout, offering a low energy threshold, exceptional energy resolution (approximately 7%), and effective background rejection through pulse-shape discrimination. The primary objective is to observe solar neutrinos in a 10-kiloton-scale detector, ultimately leading to precise measurements of the 8B flux, improved solar neutrino mixing parameters, and the first observation of the hep neutrino flux. It is also a timely technology choice for the DUNE “Module of Opportunity”, which could serve as a next-generation multi-purpose observatory for neutrinos from the MeV to the GeV range. A staged prototyping program is in progress to validate the viability of this detector concept, with a prospect to build a medium-sized demonstrator in the Boulby Underground Laboratory. Here, we present preliminary results from the prototype run in July 2023, showcasing cosmic muon tracks detected for the first time with an integrated light and charge readout.
