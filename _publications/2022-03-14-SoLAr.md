SoLAr is a new concept for a liquid-argon neutrino detector technology to extend the sensitivities of these devices to the MeV energy range - expanding the physics reach of these next-generation detectors to include solar neutrinos.
We propose this novel concept to significantly improve the precision on solar neutrino mixing parameters and to observe the "hep branch" of the proton-proton fusion chain. The SoLAr detector will achieve flavour-tagging of solar neutrinos in liquid argon. The SoLAr technology will be based on the concept of monolithic light-charge pixel-based readout which addresses the main requirements for such a detector: a low energy threshold with excellent energy resolution (approximately 7%) and background rejection through pulse-shape discrimination.
The SoLAr concept is also timely as a possible technology choice for the DUNE "Module of Opportunity", which could serve as a next-generation multi-purpose observatory for neutrinos from the MeV to the GeV range. The goal of SoLAr is to observe solar neutrinos in a 10 ton-scale detector and to demonstrate that the required background suppression and energy resolution can be achieved. SoLAr will pave the way for a precise measurement of the 8-B flux, an improved precision on solar neutrino mixing parameters, and ultimately lead to the first observation of hep neutrinos in the DUNE Module of Opportunity.
